A major challenge in the fields of biological imaging and synthetic biology is noninvasively visualizing the functions of natural and engineered cells inside opaque samples such as living animals. One promising technology that addresses this limitation is ultrasound (US), with its penetration depth of several cm and spatial resolution on the order of 100 Î¼m. Within the past decade, reporter genes for US have been introduced and engineered to link cellular functions to US signals via heterologous expression in commensal bacteria and mammalian cells. These acoustic reporter genes (ARGs) represent a novel class of genetically encoded US contrast agent, and are based on air-filled protein nanostructures called gas vesicles (GVs). Just as the discovery of fluorescent proteins was followed by the improvement and diversification of their optical properties through directed evolution, here we describe the evolution of GVs as acoustic reporters. To accomplish this task, we establish high-throughput, semiautomated acoustic screening of ARGs in bacterial cultures and use it to screen mutant libraries for variants with increased nonlinear US scattering. Starting with scanning site saturation libraries for two homologues of the primary GV structural protein, GvpA/B, two rounds of evolution resulted in GV variants with 5- and 14-fold stronger acoustic signals than the parent proteins. We anticipate that this and similar approaches will help high-throughput protein engineering play as large a role in the development of acoustic biomolecules as it has for their fluorescent counterparts.

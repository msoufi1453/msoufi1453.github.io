My name is Mohamed Soufi, and I am a Masters M2 Student at Paris-Saclay studying Systems and Synthetic Biology.
I'm interested in cell-free ribosome biogenesis (ribosomes making ribosome in vitro ) for building synthetic cells.

In short, I think synthetic cells are important to reverse-engineer and forward-engineer biological systems. For forward engineering, I draw parallels with computer science, where programmable systems have revolutionized the field. Natural cells, shaped by evolution, aren't easily programmable, which is why synthetic biology hasn't advanced as quickly as expected. Synthetic cells could change that by making biology more programmable and engineerable.
As for reverse-engineering, Feynman's quote, "What I cannot build, I do not understand," sums it up well. 

The biggest challenge I see for synthetic cells right now is cell-free ribosome biogenesis. If cell-free systems are going to serve as the cytoplasm for synthetic cells, we'll need ribosomes that can produce other ribosomes to sustain/regenerate the proteome for the synthetic cells. This is what I want to work on in my future Ph.D.

I'm always looking to connect with experts for answers to my questions and feedback on my ideas. Please reach out!

In my spare time, I like playing soccer, listening to music, and writing.
